### Envato Tuts+ Course: Learn Cycle2 for jQuery from Top to Bottom
#### Instructor: Adi Purdila

As web designers we often need some sort of slider or slideshow in our projects. And then begins the quest for finding the one that has the features we want but doesn’t break our server in half with really large source files.

Enter Cycle2. A plugin developed by Mike Alsup which has tons of features, is really easy to use and comes in at just under 20Kb.

That’s exactly what you'll learn about in this course. You’ll go through the basic and advanced usage, then the available plugins, before finishing off by learning about the API.

#### Source Files Description:

These files are a reflection of what you see in the video. Use them to work alongside the instructor.
